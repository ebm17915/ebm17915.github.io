I"~<p>This is a quick guide for anyone interested in creating a  CI/CD pipeline that auto-updates a Lambda function every time a push is made within CodeCommit. The pipeline is a great way to automate any changes you make to your Lambda function all done within a CodeCommit repository.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: There are 3 types of ways to deploy your code onto AWS Lambda</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using the in-line editor provided (up to 3 MB of Lambda code storage)</li>
  <li>Making a zipped deployment package and uploading it via console</li>
  <li>Making a zipped package and saving it in the S3 bucket. (up to 250 MB unzipped)</li>
</ul>

<p>Preview of CI/CD Pipeline:</p>

<p><strong><em>CodeCommit –&gt; CodeBuild/CodePipeline –&gt; S3 –&gt; Lambda</em></strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>You’ll want to create a CodeCommit repository dedicated to hosting your Lambda function source code.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create an S3 Bucket where our Lambda source code will be zipped and stored.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add an S3 trigger to your lambda function so whenever there is a change in the zipped Lambda code it will be called.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

  <li>
    <p>Now you’ll want to create a CodeBuild job that knows which branch and repository to pull the source Lambda code from and create the zipped file. For this step you’ll need to use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">buildspec</code> file, which is essentially a script that provides the steps necessary for the CodeBuild job. Here is an example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">buildspec</code> file:</p>

    <p>build:
 commands:
 — cd ./deploymentDir
 — zip -r deployment.zip *
 — aws s3 cp deployment.zip s3://your-bucketname/location-of-zip
 artifacts:
 files:
 — ./deploymentDir/deployment.zip</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, create a CodePipeline that will where we will set triggers on when we will run the CodeBuild step.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
