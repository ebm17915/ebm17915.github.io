I"'<p>Domain names are a great way for people to uniquely identify internet services and resources. Many people assign these text-based labels as a way to easily memorize resources rather than the numerical addresses used in the Internet protocols.</p>

<p>This will be a guide to assist in assigning a unique domain to an EC2 instance hosting an API, personal website, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This guide will be keeping costs to a minimum so paid domains and domain registering on AWS Route 53 will not be used. Here is a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/getting-started.html">link</a> to getting started with Route 53, a great domain registering alternative for developers with a larger budget.</p>

<h2>Getting a Free Domain</h2>

<p>For those on a tight budget or just simply starting to learn about domains, there are plenty of ways to acquire a domain for free. This guide will be using <a href="https://www.freenom.com/en/index.html?lang=en">Freenom.com</a>, a popular free domain server.</p>

<p>Once you’ve selected a name and went through all of checkout, view your newly acquired domain.</p>

<p>Keep this page open, it will be used in the coming steps.</p>

<h2>Pointing Domain To AWS EC2 Instance DNS</h2>

<p>Head over to the AWS console and navigate to the desired EC2 instance. It’s very important that the instance already has a web server/LAMP stack configured before proceeding.</p>

<p>Now navigate to Route 53.</p>

<p>As previously stated, Route 53 will not be used for its domain registering services (due to costs) but will be used to create a hosted zone for the new domain.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select <strong><em>create hosted zone</em></strong> and name it accordingly to the domain name. <br /></li>
  <li>Also set the zone type as <strong><em>public hosted zone</em></strong>. <br /></li>
  <li>
    <p>Finalize and save changes. <br />

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the hosted zone is created, press <strong><em>Create Record Set</em></strong> and create two A records (for www and one with an alias target of the new domain) with the IPv4 address of the EC2 instance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Navigate back to the <strong>My Domain</strong> section of freenom and select <strong>*Manage Domain</strong> <br /></li>
  <li>Go to the dropdown and select: Management Tools –&gt; Name Servers –&gt; Use custom nameservers <br /></li>
  <li>Attach the 4 nameserver values found in the recently created hosted zone and save the changes. <br />

</ol>

<p>Now search the domain name on a search engine and check out the renamed site!</p>
