Fabric is a high level Python module built on top of Paramiko to execute hell commands remotely over SSH. Those familiar with Paramiko are able to understand the underlying similarities between the two SSH modules. Similar to Paramiko, one can import the library into a Python script or install it directly to their Python interpreter. 

Here are some example code modules:

Run singular commands on an individual host instance
    >>> result = Connection('web1').run('hostname')
    web1
    >>> result
    <Result cmd='hostname' exited=0>

Single commands across multiple hosts
    >>> from fabric import SerialGroup
    >>> result = SerialGroup('web1', 'web2').run('hostname')
    web1
    web2
    >>> # Sorting for consistency...it's a dict!
    >>> sorted(result.items())
   (<Connection host=web1>, <Result cmd='hostname' exited=0>), ...]
