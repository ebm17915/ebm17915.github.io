SSH (Secure Shell) is a commonly used network protocol that securely passes communication between two computers. If a third party source were to intercept the transferred information, it would appear encrypted and unreadable. Automated server provisioning through the use of SSH is a common practice in an IT environment. I'll be covering a step-by-step guide on writing core functionality for an automation script designed to connect to remote machines in Python using Paramiko.

[Paramiko][paramiko-site] is a Python module that implements the SSH network protocol for secure connections to remote machines. It's a great tool for those who have a more pythonic approach.
