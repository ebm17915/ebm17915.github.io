There's no denying that knowledge in cloud computing is a must if aspiring Software Development Engineers and System Administrators want to land a job at their dream company. Certifications are a perfect way to demonstrate your mastery in this topic. Recently my Senior Design class was invited to participate in a cloud computing course provided by AWS. We were told by our instructor that if we were to complete this course we would be given a 50% discount on an AWS exam. 

I myself have already acquired an AWS Solutions Architect certification so I'd like to provide additional resources that some might find useful.

Practice exams provided by Jon Bonso are an excellent way to give yourself exam questions that are closely similar to the ones in the actual exam. I personally found success using these practice exams so give it a shot!
