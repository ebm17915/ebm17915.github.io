Hello and thanks for checking out Blog 2. Nothing too interesting for this week's blog aside from some tips for adding a theme to your Jekyll blog. Most users will find themselves using Minima as their default theme but luckily jekyll supports the use of custom themes. You can either create your own or go through collections of themes created by other users.
