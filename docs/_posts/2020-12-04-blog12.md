The sneaker flipping community has been around for years but as of recently there has been a surge in demand for dedicated "sneaker servers and proxies" that assist users in purchasing these limited goods. These sneaker servers host automation software provisioned to auto-purchasing limited shoe supplies off major footwear sites. This tutorial will serve as a guide to any passionate "sneakerhead" or anyone interested in hosting a low latency server.

***Note***: This is a guide for creating servers that can run large amount of tasks at high speeds. Follow other sources for the creation/purchasing of auto-purchasing software (bots).

<h3>Creating the Sneaker Server EC2 Instance</h3>

1. Log onto your AWS Console and launch a new EC2 instance.<br>
2. For the sake of compatibility with most popular auto-purchasing software, select ***Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Base***.

3. Most automation software need dedicated storage and processing power to run tasks at low latency. The most optimal options are to run instance types of ***m5ad.xlarge*** and above. For demonstration purposes, select ***m5ad.large***.

4. Configure preferential VPC and Subnet setting. Then, ***"launch"*** your instance. <br>

5. Connect to your instance by selecting ***Connect*** and navigating to the ***RDP client***. Upload the unique key pair used upon creation and generate the password necessary to access the instance. **Note** Mac needs Parallels or other RDP client software to access the instance but Windows can handle it just fine. <br>

6. Once the instance is accessed, navigate to ***Server Manager*** and disable ***Windows Defender***. This is partly due to some software not properly functioning during task creation. <br>

7. Install all automation software. Check speeds.
