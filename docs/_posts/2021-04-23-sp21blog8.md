It's a common task for database administrators to go through a giant list of data with thousands of entries. Normally these entries aren't structured in any format so passing them into a database takes a bit of formatting. The common data format would be a CSV (comma separated values) which can be imported into a database or Excel spreadsheet. There's many ways to go about converting lists of data into CSV's but this guide will cover 2 methods.

<h3> Method 1: For loop </h3>

1.  Create a new python script and import any necessary modules
```
#!/usr/local/bin/python3
import sys
import os
```
2. Depending how you call the list of data entries, create a function that iterates through all the entries and outputs a csv formatted row.
```
csv = [data1, data2, data3, data4, data5]
csv_row = ""
for item in csv:
   if type(item) = str:
      csv_row += "\"" + item + "\", "
   else:
      csv_row += str(item) + ","
print(csv_row)
```

3. Data should be outputted like so:
```
"data1","data2","data3","data4","data5"
```

<h3> Method 2: Import the built-in Python CSV module </h3>

1. Import python csv module
```
#!/usr/local/bin/python3
import sys
import os
import csv
```

2. Create a function that creates a csv file with the data imported. Here is an example
```
with open('eggs.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    spamwriter = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter=' ',
                            quotechar='|', quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)
    spamwriter.writerow(['Spam'] * 5 + ['Baked Beans'])
    spamwriter.writerow(['Spam', 'Lovely Spam', 'Wonderful Spam'])
```
