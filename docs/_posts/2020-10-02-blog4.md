This week I took a look into deploying static websites (such as this blog) into AWS using GitHub Actions. In my previous blogs I discussed using GitHub Actions in a previous blog as means of a simple CI/CD process to quickly add any desired changes to the blog whether it'd be a new theme or posts. I came across an amateur blog post that can help you deploy static sites into an S3 bucket if you want your site hosted within the cloud. I'll share a few pages that you can look into to help you migrate your site onto the AWS platform.
