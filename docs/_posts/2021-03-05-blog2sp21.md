Hosting a team application project on the cloud comes with their own unique set of challenges. This varies from account management, roles, and security. Luckily, most cloud computing providers have services dedicated to managing users and roles. This will be a guide to adding users to your Google Cloud Platform project and information detailing the IAM section of GCP.

<h3>Adding Users to the GCP Project</h3>

1. Navigate to the "IAM & Admin" section on the left-hand navigation pane. Select the IAM tab and select "+Add". <br>

2. Add members to the project by adding their Gmail addresses. **Note** Email addresses and domains must be associated with an active Google Account, G Suite account, or Cloud Identity account. <br>

3. Now select from a wide array of pre-set roles. The "Editor" role is a simple role that provides members in a group access to all GCP services. <br>

4. Alongside attaching a role to a user, conditions can be set which allows for a schedule time to access services or types of services allowed.<br>

5. All the different types of "Roles" available in the IAM section gives users the necessary tools to manage their members. This allows for greater security and chance for expensive billing errors. Greatly enough, owners can create unique roles using these preset roles to match project specifications. <br>
