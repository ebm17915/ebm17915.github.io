This is a quick guide for anyone interested in creating a  CI/CD pipeline that auto-updates a Lambda function every time a push is made within CodeCommit. The pipeline is a great way to automate any changes you make to your Lambda function all done within a CodeCommit repository.

**Note**: There are 3 types of ways to deploy your code onto AWS Lambda
* Using the in-line editor provided (up to 3 MB of Lambda code storage)
* Making a zipped deployment package and uploading it via console
* Making a zipped package and saving it in the S3 bucket. (up to 250 MB unzipped)

Preview of CI/CD Pipeline:

***CodeCommit --> CodeBuild/CodePipeline --> S3 --> Lambda***

1. You'll want to create a CodeCommit repository dedicated to hosting your Lambda function source code.

2. Create an S3 Bucket where our Lambda source code will be zipped and stored.

3. Add an S3 trigger to your lambda function so whenever there is a change in the zipped Lambda code it will be called.

4. Now you'll want to create a CodeBuild job that knows which branch and repository to pull the source Lambda code from and create the zipped file. For this step you'll need to use a `buildspec` file, which is essentially a script that provides the steps necessary for the CodeBuild job. Here is an example `buildspec` file:


    build:
    commands:
    — cd ./deploymentDir
    — zip -r deployment.zip *
    — aws s3 cp deployment.zip s3://your-bucketname/location-of-zip
    artifacts:
    files:
    — ./deploymentDir/deployment.zip

5. Finally, create a CodePipeline that will where we will set triggers on when we will run the CodeBuild step.
