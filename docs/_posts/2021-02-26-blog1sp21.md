Developers constantly face the issue of maintaining cost-efficiency when hosting their application on 3rd party platforms. Providers such as Google Cloud Platform and AWS provide developers the necessary tools to keep costs within a budget. Whether it'd be notifying through a monitoring workspace or email, budget alerts is a convenient way to ensure service costs don't exceed a certain threshold. This tutorial will be covering GCP's Cloud Billing budgets handler and how to setup a budget alert.

<h3>Creating the Project Budget and Alerts</h3>

1. First, select the project you'll be working on then proceed to the "Billing" section on the left-hand navigation pane. <br>

2. Navigate to the "Budgets & alerts" tab and select "Create Budget". <br>

3. Fill out the budget information to meet project specifications. Project managers can set the specific services the budget applies to and to add any applicable discounts/credits. The cost trend chart shown below, shows a summarized bar-chart view of the project's cost in the past 12 months. <br>

5. Move along to the "Actions" section. This section sets alert thresholds that will then email members on a list if a spend exceeds a specified amount. Make sure to specify the method of notification. Google Cloud can notify teams through direct email or can send messages to a channel withing a monitoring workspace <br>
