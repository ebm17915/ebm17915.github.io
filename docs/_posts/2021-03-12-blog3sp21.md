Copying and transferring files from server to server is a common task conducted by most IT specialists. Some use cases involve creating a sufficient amount of database backups in the case of a power outage. Standard synchronization commands used are scp and rcp but come with their own set of faults. 

On Unix-type operating systems, the rsync command synchronizes files from a source to a target, on a local machine or over a secure network connection. It's an excellent substitute for rapidly copying files to a destination server. I'll be showing a few commands and options.

|Command|Description|
|---|----|
|rsync [OPTION...] SRC... [DEST]|Local use |
|rsync [OPTION...] [USER@]HOST:SRC... [DEST]|Pulling from a remote host |
|rsync [OPTION...] SRC... [USER@]HOST:DEST|Push to a remote host|
