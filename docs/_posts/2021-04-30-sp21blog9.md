APIs (Application programming interface) can be interpreted as a composition of rules that enables developers and users to access an external service on web through our systems. Thus, an API sets certain formats which can access the service and the data to and from a model.

Through the use of Python, one can access this API data source through specific libraries.

<h3>Types of API Requests</h3>
